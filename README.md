# WEMANITY Test with Slim Framework 4 Skeleton 

## FooBarQix
You should implement a function String compute(String) which implements the following rules.

### Rules
#### Step 1
- If the number is divisible by 3, write “Foo” instead of the number
- If the number is divisible by 5, add “Bar”
- If the number is divisible by 7, add “Qix”
- For each digit 3, 5, 7, add “Foo”, “Bar”, “Qix” in the digits order.

#### Step 2
- We have a new business request: we must keep a trace of 0 in numbers, each 0 must be replaced by char “*”.

## Install the Application
